Naming Patterns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EVERYTHING is named with lowercase letters, no special characters, and
underscores for spacing (to increase readability).

Examples: brand_yellow, background_menu_color, my_awesome_mixin,
box_shadow, etc.

Be concise in naming; be not afraid of verbosity for clarity.

Bad: gnav, nav_img_cont, bib_src_lnk

Good: global_navigation_link, navigation_image_container,
bibliographic_source_link

[[keep-in-mind]]
Keep in mind:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Spelling counts!
* Naming matters – take the time to discuss with fellow developers to
find a precise, meaningful name for things. Clarity is KING!
* Be grammatically correct – if you are naming something use the proper
tense, case, etc. in order to convey the correct meaning.
* Handling Constants
* Variables should be used for any value that is used in more than one
place.
* In some cases, variables should be used for values that are used in
only one place.
* If a variable is used in only ONE file, then the variable should be
defined at the top of the file.
* If a variable is used in MORE THAN ONE file, then the variable should
be defined in the global _variables.less file.

[[mixins]]
Mixins
~~~~~~

Mixins live in a global mixins file that is not specific to any
individual application.

Mixins should be configurable, so they do not need to be project or
app-specific. Where possible, mixins should provide sane defaults for
configuration options.

Mixins should be used to create any client-specific attributes, as well
as any other complex styling (especially if those attributes are
repeated in multiple style definitions).
