Cache Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[publish-to-cdn]]
Publish to CDN
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All frontend assets should be published directly to a CDN.

[[unique-urls]]
Unique URLs
^^^^^^^^^^^

Frontend assets should be published to the CDN with a unique url. This
can easily be constructed from a version number, git sha, or a hash of
the files contents. For instance `http://cdn.com/1/main.js` or
`http://cdn.com/js/main-abc1234.js`.

[[far-future-expires]]
Far-Future Expires
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CDN should serve all assets with expiration date 1 year in the
future. This allows the browser to cache assets aggressively. Since
every asset is published with a unique URL, cache "busting" will always
be handled by requesting a different url entirely.

[[stateless-services]]
Stateless Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All service API's should be stateless if possible. Don't rely on things
like "connections" or "sesions".

[[shared-storage]]
Shared Storage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not rely on the local filesystem for anything but intra-request
temporary files, which should be created with `tmpfile()`. Instead, use
an object storage mechanism such as Amazon S3 or Openstack Swift.

[[asyncronous-processing]]
Asyncronous Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For any operation which may take more than a small fraction of a second
(100ms or so), seperate it out into an asyncronous _sooner_ rather than
_later_. Web server and proxy timeouts are fickle, and will cause your
reports to fail at the most inopportune times. Designing async in from
the beginning eliminates this risk and ensures you don't tie up valuable
connection resources waiting on timeouts.
