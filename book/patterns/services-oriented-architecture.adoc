Services Oriented Architecture
------------------------------

Backend services will be de-coupled as much as possible and delivered
via versioned REST resources. We'll maintain integration tests at the
API boundaries to control forwards and backwards compatibility.

Contracts::
    Versioned API
Loosely coupled::
    Only coupled via API
Abstract::
    Only used via API
Reusable::
    Simple designs to solve one problem
Autonomous::
    Developers should not need to work on multiple services at the same time
Stateless::
    No “sessions” or “connections”
